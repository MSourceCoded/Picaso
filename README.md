Picaso
======

Randomly generated images.

Picaso is a C# program that will generate an image under the following rules:  
-Random Background Gradient  
-Random Amount of Shapes  
-Random Amount of Vertices for each shape  
-Random Gradient for each Gradient  
-Random Title for the image  
  
It's interesting to see what randomness can do
